# Micro-Robot Simulation Project

This project simulates the behavior of a micro-robot that moves using centrifugal force and vibrations generated by two motors. The core simulation is written in C++ and generates data that can be visualized and analyzed using Python scripts. The simulation allows you to test and evaluate different control algorithms and robot dynamics based on motor behavior.

## Project Overview

The robot operates with two motors that generate centrifugal forces, which are modeled in this simulation. The robot's movement is based on the forces calculated from these motors, and the simulation helps visualize and analyze the system's behavior.

- **Motor dynamics:** The motors generate both horizontal and vertical centrifugal forces, which are calculated based on motor speed (`omega`) and angular displacement (`theta`).
- **Robot behavior:** The robot's position, velocity, and acceleration are calculated and updated based on the motor forces.
- **Control algorithms:** The simulation can be used to test different control algorithms, including feedback loops and motor coordination, for more accurate motion.

## Why This Project?

The aim of this project is to explore robot dynamics using unconventional movement principles (centrifugal forces and vibrations). It's particularly useful for understanding how robots with unconventional propulsion mechanisms, like rotating motors, behave in real-world scenarios. The project can also be extended to implement machine learning-based control algorithms or experiment with hardware-in-the-loop simulations.

## Features

- **Motor simulation:** Simulates two motors with centrifugal force generation.
- **Robot movement:** Tracks robot position, velocity, and acceleration based on motor outputs.
- **Force calculation:** Calculates the horizontal and vertical centrifugal forces produced by the motors.
- **Data export:** Saves data from the simulation, including motor states and robot movement, to CSV files for further analysis.
- **Control algorithms testing:** Can be extended to evaluate different control strategies for robot movement.

## Simulation Setup

Before running the simulation, ensure that all dependencies are installed. The simulation requires C++ and certain libraries for file I/O and numerical calculations.

### Dependencies

- **C++ Compiler:** GCC or any modern C++ compiler.
- **CMake:** For building the project.
- **Standard Libraries:** Used for I/O and file handling (`iostream`, `fstream`, etc.).

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/micro-robot-simulation.git
   cd micro-robot-simulation

   
2. **Build the Project with CMake:**

 - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
  Create a build directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```

- Run CMake to configure the project:
  ```bash
  cmake ..
  ```

- Build the project:
  ```bash
  cmake --build .
  ```

3. **Run the Simulation:**

After building the project, you can run the simulation with the following command:

  ```bash
  RobotSimulation.exe {voltage_left} {voltage_right}
  ```

The program will run and generate CSV files containing the simulation data in the data/ directory.

##Data Output
The simulation will output three CSV files:

- results_motor.csv: Contains motor-specific data, including angular velocity, angle, and centrifugal forces for each motor.
- results_robot_single.csv: Contains data for the robot's movement with a single motor, including position, velocity, acceleration, and friction forces.
- results_robot.csv: Contains data for the robot with both motors, including total forces, position, velocity, and moments.

## Results and Plots

After running the simulation, you will have CSV files containing the following data:

- **Motor Data**: Motor angles, speeds, and forces at each time step.
- **Robot Single Motor Data**: Position, velocity, acceleration, and forces for a robot with one motor.
- **Robot Double Motor Data**: Position, velocity, acceleration, forces for a robot with two motors.

### Python Plotting Scripts

You can use the following Python scripts to plot the data generated by the C++ simulation:

- **motor_plot.py**: Plots motor forces (horizontal and vertical) over time.
- **robot_single_motor_plot.py**: Plots the robot's position, velocity, and acceleration using data from a single motor.
- **robot_double_plot.py**: Plots the robot's position, velocity, acceleration, and forces from a two-motor setup.

#### Example Usage

1. **motor_plot.py**:
   - This script plots motor forces over time. Run it with:
   ```bash
   python motor_plot.py
   ```

2. **robot_single_motor_plot.py**:

  - This script plots the movement (position, velocity, acceleration) of the robot with a single motor. Run it with:
  ```bash
  python robot_single_motor_plot.py
  ```
3. **robot_double_plot.py**:

  - This script plots the movement (position, velocity, acceleration) of the robot with two motors. Run it with:
  ```bash
  python robot_double_plot.py
  ```

### Instructions:
1. Copy and paste the above section into your `README.md` file where you want the "Results and Plots" section to appear.
2. Make sure to replace any file path in the python and cpp files with your desired path .
